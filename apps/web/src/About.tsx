        Hold Short answers one question about a planned flight: <b>given this route, at this time, in this aircraft — should I go, and why?</b> It decodes the
        raw products a pilot already reads, resolves them to each point along the route at the time the aircraft will actually be there, and judges the result
        against that pilot's own personal minimums — showing the source behind every finding.
      </p>

      <p>
        Existing tools are excellent at fetching and displaying. Ask any of them "should I go?" and they hand you raw data and wish you luck. Aggregation is
        commodity; the reasoning layer is the gap.

          <h3>What is on this page</h3>
          <p>
            A real flight — St. Catharines to Waterloo in a Cessna 172, alternate Hamilton — over the reports those aerodromes were actually publishing on{' '}
            {recordedAt}. Every METAR, TAF and NOTAM below came off NAV CANADA and the US weather service and is stored here verbatim.
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>The briefing is built in your browser.</b> The page carries the reports, not a result: decoding, resolution and the rules all run here, so
            changing a personal minimum or the departure time rebuilds the verdict in front of you from the same code the server runs. It produces the same
            briefing, down to the content hash — there is a test that fails if it ever does not.
          </p>
          <p className="hint">
            What it cannot do is fetch. Neither weather service allows a page to call it directly, so the reports are frozen at the moment they were recorded,
            and there is data for {aerodromes.length > 0 ? aerodromes.map((a) => a.id).join(', ') : 'a few aerodromes'} only. The flight departs at 22:00Z
            rather than its real time so that the recorded forecasts cover it; everything else is exactly as it was.

          <ol className="rules">
            <li>
              <b>No model anywhere near the decoders.</b> A METAR has exactly one correct parse. Non-determinism there is a defect, not a trade-off.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Nothing is ever hidden.</b> Relevance ranking changes order and what is collapsed. A model error must degrade to noise, never to a missing item.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Every finding cites its source.</b> Not the report — the span within it. A verdict without the raw text beside it is worse than no verdict.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Zulu internally, always.</b> Local time exists only at the display edge.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Raw reports are stored verbatim</b>, content-addressed and append-only, so what was known at any moment can be reconstructed exactly.

      <h3>Where a model is used, and how far it is trusted</h3>
      <p>
        Two places, both optional and both running locally on a laptop GPU: ranking NOTAMs by relevance to this flight, and reading weight-and-balance figures
        out of a scanned handbook. Everything else — decoders, rules engine, the arithmetic — is deterministic.
      </p>
      <p>
        Neither is trusted on its word. A NOTAM assessment must quote the NOTAM verbatim or it is demoted to <i>unverified</i> and ranked below assessments that
        did. A figure read out of the handbook is used only if the quoted line is on that page, the number is in that line, and the line names the field — and
        the handbook prints its normal and utility weight limits in the same layout, so that last check caught the model reading one as the other.
      </p>
      <p>
        The decisions a small model should not be making were taken away from it. A closed runway at the departure aerodrome is settled from the ICAO Q code,
        not asked about. That change took relevance agreement from 61.5% to 85.7% — but more to the point, it is why a runway closure can no longer be missed
        at all.

        Each of those is produced by a test in the repository, not an estimate. The two numbers a reader should be most suspicious of — the model ones — are the
        ones with a gate: extraction precision is a hard failure if it slips, and recall is deliberately not gated, because a figure the model misses waits in a
        review queue and a figure it invents does not.
