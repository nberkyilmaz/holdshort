/**
 * The pipeline, in the browser.

 * Neither weather service lets a page call it directly, so a briefing of a

 * not: decoding, resolution and the rules are ordinary deterministic code.
 * So the published site carries the reports themselves, loads them into an
 * in-memory store, and builds the briefing here — the same code the API
 * runs, producing a briefing with the same content hash.
 *
 * That is why changing a personal minimum on this page changes the verdict
 * immediately and honestly, rather than showing a different picture of a
 * result decided somewhere else.
