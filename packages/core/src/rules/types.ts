 * products say, compares it against the limits that pilot set, and puts the
 * things that deserve a second look at the top. The words are deliberately
 * about reading rather than about going:
 *
 * `routine` — measured, and within the limit you set.
 * `note`    — worth knowing: a forecast borrowed from a neighbour, night,
 *             the wind at cruise.
 * `caution` — a limit crossed in a temporary or probabilistic period, or a
 *             hazard near but not on the route.
 * `alert`   — a limit crossed in the prevailing conditions or the
 *             observation, or a hazard reported where you are going.
 *
 * An `alert` is not "do not go". It is "you asked to be told about this, and
 * here it is, with the report it came from".
