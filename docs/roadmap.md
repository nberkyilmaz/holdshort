# Roadmap

The goal, stated plainly: **everything a pilot looks at before a flight, in
one place, with a reason and a source behind every line of it.** Not all at
once — steadily, and each piece finished before the next is started.

**This tool does not decide whether to fly.** It reports what the products
say, compares them against the limits the pilot set, and puts what deserves a
second look first. The decision is the pilot's. Where a summary is needed,
it is the flight category — VFR, MVFR, IFR, LIFR — which is an objective
classification of ceiling and visibility, not an opinion.

Two rules that do not bend as it grows. Nothing is ever hidden: ranking and
collapsing change what you see first, never what exists. And every finding
carries the span of the report it was judged on, because a statement without
its source is worth nothing.

This is a study and planning aid. It is not, and will not become, an
official briefing.

## Where things stand

### Done

| | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| **METAR / TAF decoders** | Span-annotated, total, no model anywhere near them. Under 0.3 % of tokens unparsed across 8,000 real reports. |
| **Fetch and store** | Every report kept verbatim, content-addressed, append-only, so what was known at any moment can be reconstructed. |
| **Route and time** | ETA per waypoint; the forecast period that governs each one, prevailing versus overlay. |
| **Rules engine** | Personal minimums, CARs 602.114/115, FAR 91.155, crosswind per runway on true headings. Every finding cited. |
| **Briefings** | Immutable, content-addressed, reproducible; an API and a web view. |
| **NOTAM relevance** | Decoded, filtered by time and geography, deduped; deterministic rules where there is one right answer, a local model for the rest. |
| **Evaluation harness** | A reviewed labelled set and a gate that fails the build, not a claim in a README. |
| **Briefing diff** | What changed since last time, measured against the verdict rather than the text. |
| **Weight and balance** | Read out of a scanned handbook, every figure checked against the ink before it is used. |
| **Forecast verification** | Did the TAF turn out to be right, and which way was it wrong. |
| **Winds and temperatures aloft** | Interpolated to the altitude flown; the temperature at cruise as the first question about icing. |
| **Daylight** | Last light on arrival and how much of it is left, from the same solar arithmetic the night rules use. |
| **Nav log** | The wind triangle leg by leg, with a blank and a reason wherever a number cannot be had. |
| **Hazard advisories** | SIGMETs and AIRMETs that are in force, at your altitude, and across your route. |
| **The site** | Five pages, running the whole pipeline in the browser over reports it carries. |

### Blocked, and on what

- **Airspace transit** needs Canadian airspace geometry, which NAV CANADA
  does not publish. The FAA's layer is queryable, so the US half is
  buildable whenever it is wanted.
- **US NOTAMs** need FAA API credentials. Canadian ones need no key.

## Next

### 0. Take the verdict out, and judge what is decoded — in progress

The go/no-go verdict is being removed in favour of reporting. In the same
pass, the rules engine has to start reading what the decoders already hand
it: present weather (thunderstorms, freezing rain, fog, snow), total wind
speed, and indeterminate ceilings (`BKN///`, `VV///`). Today a heavy
thunderstorm with freezing rain produces three lines saying everything is
fine, because no rule reads the weather groups.

Then, in order: report age shown in colour; the nearest reporting station
when a field's own is asleep; takeoff and landing distance from the POH;
a page per aerodrome; fuel planning; airspace.

### 1. Make the site usable — done, except for live weather

The pipeline works and nobody could use it. That came before every feature
below, because a feature nobody can reach is not finished.

Done: a form that forgives, with aerodrome lookup rather than free text and
a plan that survives a reload; a verdict scannable in five seconds with the
reasoning one tap away; a phone layout; what the briefing could not see,
stated beside the verdict rather than left to be inferred. And the page
runs the pipeline itself, so changing a minimum rebuilds the verdict in the
browser rather than showing a different picture of one.

What is left is **live weather**, which needs a host, because neither
weather service allows a browser to call it directly. The image and the
rate limits are done; it needs the owner's accounts. Until then the site
briefs over reports frozen at the moment they were recorded, and says so.

### 2. The rest of the weather picture

Each is the same shape as METAR and TAF — fetch, decode with spans, store
verbatim, feed the rules — so they get cheaper as they go.

- ~~**Winds and temperatures aloft.**~~ Done. Interpolated to the altitude
  being flown, with the temperature at cruise as the first question about
  icing. Fetched for the route rather than the aerodromes, because a small
  field is almost never an upper wind site.
- ~~**SIGMET and AIRMET.**~~ Done. In force, at your altitude, and across
  your route — all three, or it is not mentioned. An area the geometry
  cannot answer for is reported as needing to be checked by eye.
- **PIREPs.** What somebody up there actually found, which is often the
  only honest answer about icing and turbulence.
- **Graphical area forecast.** Images rather than text, so a different kind
  of work: show it, do not pretend to reason about it.

### 3. The nav log — done

True course, the wind triangle, heading, groundspeed, time and fuel, leg by
leg, with the reason printed wherever a number is missing.

Two things it still wants. **Magnetic** courses need variation, which
OurAirports does not publish and NASR does — so a US field gets magnetic
today and a Canadian one does not; the fix is a variation model rather than
a data source. And **fuel reserve** against fuel aboard, which needs the
handbook's burn table read out the way the weight-and-balance figures
were.

### 4. Daylight — done

Sunrise, sunset, civil twilight and how much daylight is left on arrival,
which is the question before "is this a night flight". The *next* of each
event rather than the day's, because last light in Ontario falls after
midnight Zulu for half the year.

### 5. More out of the handbook

The document pipeline is built and proven on weight and balance. The same
machinery reads:

- **Takeoff and landing distance**, against the actual runway, altitude and
  temperature — which is where a short strip on a hot day stops being fine.
- **Airworthiness dates**: annual, transponder, ELT, pitot-static. A flight
  can be legal on weather and illegal on paperwork.

### 6. Pilot currency

Medical, flight review, ninety-day passenger currency, night currency. The
same shape as personal minimums, and the same treatment: a finding with a
date and a citation, never a silent pass.

### 7. Then the blocked ones

Airspace transit when geometry can be found; US NOTAMs when credentials
arrive.

## After the web

A mobile application, once the web version has earned it. The pipeline is
already a library with no interface assumptions, an HTTP surface on top and
a store behind an interface, so the work is a client rather than a rewrite.

Worth doing in this order for a reason: a phone is where a pilot stands
beside the aeroplane, and a briefing that is not trustworthy on a laptop
will not become trustworthy on a phone.
